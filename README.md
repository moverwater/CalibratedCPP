# The Calibrated Coalescent Point Process
[![Docker CI](https://github.com/moverwater/CalibratedCPP/actions/workflows/maven-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/moverwater/CalibratedCPP/actions/workflows/maven-tests.yml)

This is an implementation of the Calibrated Coalescent Point Process (Calibrated CPP) in BEAST2.

The CPP is a model of ultrametric trees where node ages are i.i.d. random variables. This captures a general class of birth-death processes with time-dependent birth and death rates (as in BDSKY) and age dependent death rates.
- Individuals die at some rate $\mu(x,t)$ that depends on the age of the individual $x$ and the time $t$.
- Individuals give birth to new individuals at a rate $\lambda(t)$ depending only on time.

[Lambert and Stadler (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2013.10.002) show that these models give a uniform distribution over ranked labelled (or oriented) tree topologies, and that the node ages are i.i.d. random variables. The node age density where $\lambda=\lambda(t)$ and $\mu=\mu(x,t)$ and each individual is sampled with probability $\rho$ is,

$$q(t) = \frac{\rho\lambda (\lambda-\mu)e^{-(\lambda-\mu)t}}{\rho\lambda+(\lambda(1-\rho)-\mu)e^{-(\lambda-\mu)t}}$$

the cumulative distribution function is,

$$Q(t) = \frac{\rho\lambda(1-e^{-(\lambda-\mu)t})}{\rho\lambda+(\lambda(1-\rho)-\mu)e^{-(\lambda-\mu)t}}.$$

The Calibrated CPP is a calibrated tree prior using the CPP. Calibrated tree priors are used for molecular clock dating by conditioning on the existence and ages of the most recent common ancestors of monophyletic clades.

## Project structure
CalibratedCPP contains 5 subprojects:

### calibratedcpp-beast

The implementation has the following structure:
- `CalibratedCoalescentPointProcess` extends `SpeciesTreeDistribution` and takes a list of `calibrations`, `tree`, and the `origin` age OR `conditionOnRoot` as inputs.
- `CalibratedBirthDeathModel` extends `CalibratedCoalescentPointProcess` and implements `calculateLogNodeAgeDensity()` and `calculateLogNodeAgeCDF()` with node age density and CDF for the constant rate birth-death process.
- `CalibratedBirthDeathSkylineModel` extends `CalibratedCoalescentPointProcess` and implements `calculateLogNodeAgeDensity()` and `calculateLogNodeAgeCDF()` with node age density and CDF for the birth-death process with piecewise constant rates.
- `CalibratedAgeDependentBirthDeathModel` extends `CalibratedCoalescentPointProcess` and implements `calculateLogNodeAgeDensity()` and `calculateLogNodeAgeCDF()` for the case when individuals have arbitrary lifetime distributions and give birth at a constant rate. The special case where individuals have Erlang distributed (Gamma distributed with integer shape parameter) lifetimes has a fast solution.

### calibratedcpp-lphy

The Lphy simulator is currently implemented within LinguaPhylo as a generative method called `CalibratedCPP`:
- The simulator takes birth rate, death rate, sampling probability for the birth-death process.
- Calibration information is taken from the output of `ConditionedMRCAPrior`, other leaf names are optional to pass in.
- Stem age can be passed in if there is no root calibration, but if root calibration and stemAge are both specified, the tree will still be root conditioned.

### calibratedcpp-lphy-studio

The Lphy studio is a visualiser that users can type in Lphy scripts directly or load local lphy scripts.
Calibrations can be viewed as calibration taxa names and the sampled ages.

### calibratedcpp-lphybeast

This subproject is converting Lphy simulators to XMLs for BEAST2 running:
- The simulator set conditionOnCalibrations as true for default, users should manually modify this flag in the output XML to make it turn off.
- Construct BirthDeathSkylineModel with birth death parameters and conditions on the origin of the tree. The birth and death rates are SkylineParameter, which allow users to specify how times varies. Default false as BEAST2 model, users can manually change the XML to turn them on.
- Set calibrations in CalibrationPrior, taking upper and lower bounds of the calibration nodes that passed to ConditionedMRCAPrior.

### calibratedcpp-lphybeast-launcher

This module is for launching lphybeast.
Run from the project root:
```angular2html
mvn -pl calibratedcpp-lphybeast-launcher exec:exec -Dlphybeast.args="convert ../calibratedcpp-lphy/examples/example.lphy"
mvn -pl calibratedcpp-lphybeast-launcher exec:exec -Dlphybeast.args="run -l 30000000 ../calibratedcpp-lphy/examples/example.lphy"
```

## Well-Calibrated Study
Run LPhyBEAST using the configuration described in the [Developer Guide](#developer-guide).
Simulated parameter values will be written to the `.log` file, while the trees, alignment, and calibrations information will be saved to separate output files.
The simulated data are set as the starting values in the LPhyBEAST-generated XML, which can be passed directly to BEAST2 for Bayesian phylogenetic inference.
BEAST2 produces a posterior distribution that can be compared with the data generated by LPhyBEAST for well-calibrated study.

Run from the project root:
```bash
# Convert with 100 replicates
mvn -pl calibratedcpp-lphybeast-launcher exec:exec -Dlphybeast.args="convert -r 100 ../calibratedcpp-lphy/examples/wellCalibratedStudy.lphy"

# Run BEAST3 on each replicate
for i in {0..99}; do
    echo "Running wellCalibratedStudy_r${i}.xml"
    mvn -pl calibratedcpp-beast exec:exec -Dbeast.args="-overwrite examples/b3test/wellCalibratedStudy_r${i}.xml"
done
```
