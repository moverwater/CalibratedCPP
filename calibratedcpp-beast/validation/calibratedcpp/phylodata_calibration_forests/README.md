# PhyloData Calibration Forest Constraint Trees

Calibration constraint trees extracted from BEAST2 XML files in the PhyloData repository.
These represent real-world calibration structures used in published phylogenetic analyses.

## Data Pipeline

Starting from 222 BEAST2 XML files downloaded via [phylodata](https://pypi.org/project/phylodata/):

| Stage | Count | Reason |
|-------|-------|--------|
| PhyloData BEAST2 XMLs | 222 | Raw input |
| Files with MRCAPrior calibrations | 157 | 65 have no node-age calibrations |
| After removing single-taxon calibrations | 136 | Tip-dating leaf constraints only |
| After removing tip-dated analyses | 128 | Non-contemporaneous taxa not supported |
| Unique calibration forests | 96 | Deduplicated by calibration structure |
| After removing overlapping calibrations | 93 | Non-nested overlaps are methodologically invalid |

**Filtering details:**
- **Tip-dated analyses**: CalibratedCPP assumes contemporaneous tips
- **Single-taxon calibrations**: These are tip-dating constraints, not clade calibrations
- **Overlapping calibrations**: 3 files (hara-2021, harrington-wn6u, serrano-zc3e) have calibrations with non-nested taxon set overlaps - likely researcher errors in the original XML
- **Multi-gene duplicates**: Automatically deduplicated (same calibration applied to multiple gene trees → keep one)

## Format

Annotated Newick format with BEAST-style metadata:
```
((A,B)[&name=Clade1,dist=LogNormal,M=5.2,S=0.5,offset=33.9],(C,D)[&name=Clade2])[&name=Root];
```

## Benchmark Results

All 93 constraint trees benchmark successfully with CalibratedCoalescentPointProcess.

**Regression model** (R² = 0.99):
```
time(μs) = 0.011 × complexity + 0.082 × taxa + 111.3
```

Where complexity = Σ 2^k × k³ for each calibration node with k children.

**Top 5 by execution time:**
